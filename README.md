# About

**World GDP Dashboard** is an interactive data visualization project that allows users to explore the economic output of countries around the world through a graphical interface.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the **total monetary value of goods and services produced within a country**, making it one of the most widely used indicators to measure economic performance and compare global economies. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This project demonstrates how **Python and Streamlit can be used to build interactive analytical dashboards**, enabling users to explore global economic data visually.

The project serves as:

- A **data analytics portfolio project**
- A **data visualization learning project**
- A **demonstration of dashboard development using Python**

---

# Project Overview

The dashboard allows users to interactively explore GDP data by:

- Selecting specific countries
- Filtering by year
- Comparing economic output
- Observing global GDP trends
- Analyzing country-level economic growth patterns

The dashboard converts static economic datasets into **interactive visual insights**, making complex economic data easier to understand.

---

# Features

Key features of the dashboard include:

### Interactive Data Visualization
Users can dynamically interact with the dataset and visualize GDP values across different countries and time periods.

### Country-Level Analysis
Allows exploration of GDP performance for individual countries.

### Year-Based Filtering
Users can analyze GDP values across different years to identify growth patterns.

### Simple and Intuitive Interface
The dashboard is designed to be minimal, intuitive, and easy to navigate.

### Real-Time Data Exploration
Users can instantly change filters and view updated visualizations.

---

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains GDP values for different countries.

Typical fields included in GDP datasets are:

- Country Name
- Country Code
- Year
- GDP Value

Many global GDP datasets originate from trusted economic sources such as:

- World Bank
- OECD National Accounts
- International Monetary Fund (IMF)

These datasets track economic output across countries and years to support global economic analysis.

---

# Technologies Used

The dashboard is built using the following technologies:

### Programming Language
- Python 3

### Libraries
- **Streamlit** – Web app framework for data applications
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and processing
- **Plotly / Visualization tools** – Data visualization
- **NumPy** – Numerical computation

### Development Environment
- Jupyter Notebook / Python environment
- VS Code / Anaconda

### File Description

**streamlit_app.py**

Main application file that runs the Streamlit dashboard.

**data/**

Contains the dataset used for GDP analysis.

**requirements.txt**

Lists all Python dependencies required to run the application.

**README.md**

Project documentation.

### How to run it on your own machine
---

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

# Usage

Once the dashboard loads:

1. Select a **country** from the dropdown menu.
2. Use the **year slider** to explore historical GDP values.
3. Observe visual charts representing economic output.
4. Compare economic performance across different time periods.

The interface automatically updates the visualizations based on user selections.

---

# Data Analysis Insights

Using the dashboard, users can analyze patterns such as:

- Countries with the highest GDP output
- Economic growth trends across years
- Comparative economic performance between nations
- Global economic distribution patterns

These insights help understand the **relative economic strength of countries worldwide**.

---

# Limitations

This project has a few limitations:

- Dataset may not include the most recent economic data.
- The dashboard focuses only on GDP and does not include other indicators like inflation, unemployment, or trade balances.
- The dataset may not cover all countries.

---

# Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:

### Additional Economic Indicators
Add datasets for:

- Inflation
- Population
- GDP per capita
- Trade balance

### Advanced Visualizations
Integrate more advanced charts such as:

- World GDP heat maps
- GDP growth comparison graphs
- Animated economic timelines

### Deployment
Deploy the dashboard using:

- Streamlit Cloud
- AWS
- Azure

### Machine Learning Integration
Add predictive analytics to forecast future GDP trends.
